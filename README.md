ðŸ”´ LED with Arduino

This project demonstrates how to control an LED using an Arduino board. It covers basic operations such as turning an LED *on, **off, and **blinking* it at regular intervals using simple Arduino code. This is one of the most fundamental and beginner-friendly projects in Arduino development, ideal for learning digital output and understanding how to use the pinMode() and digitalWrite() functions.


ðŸ”§ Hardware Requirements

* Arduino Uno (ESP8266 (NodeMCU))
* LED
*  Resistor
* Breadboard and jumper wires


ðŸ§  Key Concepts

* Digital I/O pins
* pinMode() to set pin as OUTPUT
* digitalWrite() to control voltage level (HIGH/LOW)
* Basic delay and timing using delay()
